# AgriSense

AgriSense is an IoT-based smart agriculture monitoring system aimed at tackling major challenges in modern farming, such as inefficient irrigation, harmful gas exposure, and the lack of real-time environmental data. The system uses an ESP32-based sensor network to monitor important parameters like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and harmful gases (CO, CH₄, NH₃, and H₂S). It provides farmers with actionable data through a user-friendly web application that helps in making informed decisions and enhancing agricultural practices.

## About the Project

This project integrates various sensors to continuously track environmental conditions and air quality. Data is transmitted in real-time to a web dashboard, where it’s visualized for easy monitoring. The dashboard displays:
- Soil moisture levels
- Temperature and humidity
- Air quality and gas concentration levels
- Exposure time recommendations based on gas concentrations

The platform also includes features like crop-specific cultivation tips, fertilizer requirement calculations, a database of pests and diseases, and a financial record-keeping system to help farmers manage their expenses and income.

This system aims to improve productivity, sustainability, and economic viability by providing farmers with the tools to optimize resources, ensure safety, and boost farm output.

## Features

- Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters
- Real-time data visualization via a web dashboard
- Alerts for harmful gas concentrations and exposure guidelines
